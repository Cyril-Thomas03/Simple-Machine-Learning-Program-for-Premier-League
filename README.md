# Machine-Learning-Program-for-Premier-League
A program that utilizes sklearn to do simple machine learning to predict stats based on data given. Is used through a simple tkinter interface and also utulizes panda to read files as well as numpy for the data. 

The machine learning aspect of the program was created through following a tutorial by tech with tim and thus the sole purpose was to learn how machine learning works as well as practising tkinter which I had just learned. 

Installations:
Numpy, pandas, sklearn
